Milestone 1: Project Overview
This project is a full-stack e-commerce platform developed using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It integrates scalable APIs, secure authentication, and robust product management functionalities to provide a seamless user experience.


1. User Authentication
The e-commerce platform includes secure login and registration functionalities with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that user sessions are properly managed, and sensitive data is accessed only by authorized individuals.

Register: Enables new users to sign up.
Login: Authenticates users and provides a secure session using JWT tokens.

2. Product Management
The product management system allows administrators to add, update, retrieve, and delete products efficiently.

Add Product: Allows adding new products with necessary details.
Update Product: Enables updating product details such as price, description, or images.
Retrieve Products: Provides an easy way to fetch product listings.
Delete Product: Removes products from the database when necessary.

3. Order Management
The platform offers a comprehensive system to manage customer orders, ensuring a seamless purchasing experience.

Create Order: Allows users to place orders for products.
Update Order: Provides options to update order details (e.g., shipping address, quantity).
View Order: Facilitates viewing order history and status.

4. RESTful APIs
The e-commerce platform uses RESTful API design, which organizes interactions between the client and server into standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This ensures a clean and scalable communication process with the database.
Each endpoint is designed to handle specific tasks, such as retrieving product data or managing user accounts.

5. Scalable Backend
The backend of the e-commerce platform is developed using Node.js and Express.js, making it highly efficient in handling multiple concurrent requests. This allows for fast performance even with a growing user base.

6. Responsive Frontend
The frontend is built using html, css, java script React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. React.js enhances user interaction by offering components that handle views efficiently, resulting in a smoother, faster, and more intuitive experience for customers.
